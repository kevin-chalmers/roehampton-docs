# Overview

## Questions to Ask for Each Unit/Activity

1. Where are the learners starting from?
2. Where do we want them to get to?
3. How will we know when they're there?
4. How can we best help them get there?

## Lean Habits

1. **Backward design** - start with the end in mind.
2. **Knowing knowledge** - establish the route towards expertise.
3. **Checking understanding** - build on what they know, not what they don't.
4. **Effective activities** - select and streamline for the shortest path.
5. **Lasting learning** - build memory that lasts and is easy to recall.
6. **Inter-lesson planning** - plan for the past and into the future.
7. **Build excellence** - leverage habits to create lasting change.
8. **Growth teaching** - innovate, evaluate, and iterate to improve.
9. **Collective improvement** - get better together for compound growth.

### Starting with the End in Mind

1. Start your planning with the following question: what do I want my students to have learnt by the end of the lesson.
2. Spend more time on this activity than you think you should.

#### Learning Milestones

Identify a range of learning milestones for your lessons.  Tasks students are unable to do at the start of the lesson, but with support, may achieve by the end.

Effective learning milestones:

- **Cumulative** - they build on one another, so just like milestones in real life, passing one will take you close to the next.
- **Distributed** - they are spread out in such a way that the majority of students can pass the first, but few can pass the last.
- **Measurable** - they are clearly signposted so you can easily tell when your students have passed them.
- **Clear** - they are phrased in such a way that you and your students can quickly understand what they are aiming for.

### Knowing Knowledge

Get into the habit of asking yourself questions such as:

- Is this lesson about building tools, or learning to use them better?
- What is the best order and interplay between these activities?

### Checking Understanding

Assessments at various points:

- Entry (not that useful).
- Transition between activities.  Test students understand the explanation.
- Exit (below).

#### Exit Assessment

Set a timer to go off X minutes before the end of the lesson, and use a timeboxed exit ticket.

This is a small slip of paper with 3-5 questions that students complete within a certain time, and then hand to you as they walk out the door.  The questions on this ticket have a dual purpose:

1. Progress - to assess where students are on the path through the learning milestones.
2. Prep - to establish aspects of prior knowledge to help you plan for a future lesson.

### Efficient Activities

What is the least that needs to happen for my students to make progress towards their next learning milestone?

#### Teaching for Attention

- Constrain teacher-led talk to bursts of 5-10 minutes.
- Keep most activities to around 15 minutes, being sensitive to the costs of task-switching.
- Avoid tasks that require students to focus on multiple things at once.
- Use activity structure instead of instruction where possible.

Ask yourself questions such as:

- What is the least amount of explanation my students need before they can move on?
- What is the least amount of deliberate practice they need to make progress?

#### Success Through Challenge

- **Low floor, high ceiling** - one task that is accessible to all, but can be taken as far as each student is able.  These are often open-ended, or investigative in nature.
- **All start, no finish** - a series of questions graduated in difficulty so everyone can answer the first one, but no one can answer the last.

#### Feedback

- Closes the gap between where students are and the next learning milestone.
- Focuses on how to help students move on, not on what went wrong.
- Is provided alongside multiple opportunities to put into practice.
- Focuses on the single smallest thing that will help them make the most progress.
- Offers formative comments rather than marks.

### Lasting Learning

*Multi-tasking is the wrong option anytime you expect to learn, acquire knowledge, or think deeply.*

Multi-tasking normally means task-switching, which has a cost (the context switch).  Eliminate task-switching to save time.  This will improve learning through concentration.

When planning a lesson, ask yourself: **what exactly do I want my students to be thinking about?  And what do I NOT want my students to be wasting their bandwidth on?

#### Anchoring Thinking

Anchor new thinking by:

- Exploring what your students already know about the topic, and using this as a starting point when designing and selecting activities.
- Finding out what they are interested in and using this to create a context that is meaningful to them.
- Helping them identify connections between what they are learning and what they already know.

Concept mapping can be useful in helping to achieve these outcomes.

#### Spaced Learning

Here is a basic timeline of spaced (or distributed) learning:

1. **First encounter**: expose students to an idea or process for the first time during part of a lesson.
2. **Days later**: reactivate the learning next time you see the students, with a recap of key ideas, and a few consolidation activities.
3. **Weeks later**: repeat in a similar way a few lessons down the line, and again a few weeks later.

Between visits alter the learning experience a little, but not too much.  Add elements or change the context, but make sure the previous encounter is still highly recognisable.

And at the start check where they are: **what do you remember from the last time we explored this?**

#### Deliberate Practice

To help fluency, plan regular opportunities for deliberate practice.

- **Practice the core**: practice fewer, more important things in greater depth.
- **Practice first**: provide opportunities to consolidate existing understanding before being exposed to more.
- **Feed forward**: offer high quality feedback on how to improve alongside opportunities for further practice.
- **Graduated challenge**: increase the challenge little by little rather than in big jumps.
- **Bright spots**: practice things you are already good at, as well as what you need to improve.
- **Drill the basics**: drill basic ideas and processes to free up bandwidth for more complex learning.
- **Practice success**: practice learning from mistakes rather than making them.

### Inter-lesson planning

Ask yourself:

- **What previous learning do we need to revisit in today's lesson?**.
- **What prior knowledge to I need to assess today so I can plan properly for my next lesson?**

### Growth Teaching

1. Innovate
    1. **Diagnose** - Identify a part of your teaching to improve.
2. Evaluate
    1. **Design** - Develop a (potentially) better approach.
    2. **Teach** - Try it out in your classroom over time.
    3. **Measure** - Evaluate the impact of this new approach.
    4. **Learn** - Figure out what's happening.  Rinse and repeat.
3. Iterate

#### Balanced Evaluation

A robust evaluation combines multiple approaches:

1. **Progress indicators** - data from exit-assessments, in-class assessments, and results from tests.
2. **Observational perspectives** - feedback from any other teachers or self-video recordings.
3. **Student surveys** - feedback from students using targeted questions, post-it notes, exit assessments, or discussion.

### Collective Improvement

Set aside an hour every 1-2 weeks with a protected agenda to discuss how to improve.

Use the following framework:

1. **Isolate** - what am I currently focusing on and why?
2. **Situate** - what context am I doing this in?
3. **Validate** - How do I know when it's working (or not)?
4. **Narrate** - how did this come about and what's next?
5. **Kickstart** - how can someone else get started with this?
